This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the Material UI framework (https://material-ui.com/).

## Currently deployed on Github Pages at https://hsmitty93.github.io/tomato_time/

## About
This project was created to learn more about building react apps. If you're not familiar with pomodoro time management, it works by having you spend 25min focusing on a task then having 5 min as a break. This repeats, until the 4th time you spend 25min focused on the task then you recieve a longer break. With my web app I joined the pomodoro timer and a tasks app together. You can create a task, assign how long you think it's going to take to complete it. (In the form of tomato icons, each tomato = 25min of work) Select a task to work on and start the work timer! After 25min of work you will see a tomato filled on your selected task, indicating you have spent 25min working on that task. 

## Current Features
- Indicate how long you expect to work on a task
- Shows indication of how long you've been working on a selected task
- Add, delete and complete a task
- Pomodoro timer for work, short and long breaks.

## Future Features
- Persistant storage for tasks
- Settings for changing timer length for work, short and long breaks.
- Filter tasks based on completion, not started and currently in progress tasks
- Improve design and responsiviness for smaller screen sizes
